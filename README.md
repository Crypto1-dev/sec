# SEC Alpha Interpreter (Web Version)

This is a basic web editor and interpreter for the SEC programming language (alpha version). It runs entirely in the browser â€” no installs or servers needed.

## ðŸ’¡ What is SEC?

SEC (Secure Efficient Code) is a custom language that uses block-style logic and library calls. This version includes two main libraries:

- `main::` â€“ handles display, math, input, etc.
- `shadow::` â€“ supports JavaScript and delay-style commands
